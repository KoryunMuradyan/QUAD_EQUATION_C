compile the program with just "make" command or with its options (test, debug, coverage, profile,  ets) whatever you want 
then run the executable with command command like this "./executable filename" or do the same as it is preferable with "make test".
there should exist golden.txt file containing the right result (the last should be defined in golden.txt by user manually) of the equataion from input.txt
then after execution if no error accurs the programm will compare the result generated by itself and compare that with the one from golden.txt afterwards 
an output.txt file containing the results (not matter wrong or right) will be generated
